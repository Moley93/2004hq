<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Lady Servil and agree to help her rescue her family. Head east and go into the most northeastern house, open the chest and take armor, put it on.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go just south into the prison, the guard will let you in if your wearing the armor. Talk to Jeremy through the cage. He'll tell you the guard has the keys.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go into the southeast corner room and talk to the guard. He'll mention that Khali brew makes him sleep. Go west to the tavern and grab some. Then return and speak to him. He'll give you the keys and get drunk.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Use the keys on Jeremy's door and you'll run out to the arena. Save Justin Servil from a level 55 Khazard ogre. The General will take you prisoner to fight again after you kill the ogre.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Hengrad, and soon you'll be taken out to the arena to fight again. First, you'll have to defeat a level 44 Khazard Scorpion. Defeat it to fight the level 132 Bouncer. After you defeat them both, kill level 112 General Khazard. See note below for useful tips on defeating them.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Note: The Bouncer can follow you anywhere in the arena, so use that to your advantage. There's a carcass on the west side of the scaffold; position yourself on one side of it and your opponent on the other. You can shoot at him without getting attacked. In my opinion, using Magic is much more effective than Ranging.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>If you leave before you've killed the General to get food or something, and when you return it says you can't go in because it's locked, head to Lady Servil—you're done. (This happened to me.) On the other hand, if you defeat them, talk to one of the Servils, then head to Lady Servil to claim your reward. (Congratulations)</div>
