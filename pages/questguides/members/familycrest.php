<br>

<h3>Starting Out:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>1. Go to the little house southeast of the East bank in Varrock. You should find a man named Dimintheis.</div>
<br>
<img src="img/questimages/famcrest1.jpg" height="220" width="220"><img src="img/questimages/famcrest2.jpg" height="200" width="200"><br>
<br>
<div data-progress>Talk to him about the family crest. You will need to talk to his sons who have the pieces of the crest. Do them in the order below.</div>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>First Son:</h3>
<img src="img/questimages/famcrest3.jpg" height="220" width="220"><img src="img/questimages/famcrest4.jpg" height="200" width="200"><br>
<br>
<br>
<div data-progress>1. Talk to the Chef, who is located in a house just northeast of the Catherby bank. Talk to him, and he'll give you his piece of the crest
    if you provide the following cooked fish. Note: If you don't have a high enough Cooking or Fishing level, you can buy the fish instead.</div>
<br>
Shrimp<br>
Salmon<br>
Tuna<br>
Bass<br>
Swordfish<br>
<br>
<div data-progress>2. Give him these fish and he will give you his piece of the crest. He should tell you about the second brother
    in Al Kharid. If he doesn't, talk to him again and he will tell you to go to the Gem Trader in Al Kharid.</div>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Second Son:</h3>
<div data-progress>1. Talk to the Gem Trader in Al Kharid. He will tell you about a man with a poncey yellow cape who hangs around the gold rock
    in the Scorpion Pit Chasm mine north of Al Kharid.</div>
<br>
<div data-progress>2. Talk to this Nobleman and he will tell you that if you want his part of the crest you will need to give him a ruby ring
    and a ruby necklace made from the finest gold. He will tell you that a dwarf named Boot knows where to find the finest gold.</div>
<br>
<img src="img/questimages/famcrest5.jpg" height="220" width="220"><img src="img/questimages/famcrest6.jpg" height="200" width="200"><br>
<br>
<div data-progress>3. Go talk to Boot who is in the Dwarven Mine. See the world map if you can't find Dwarven Mine. (Hint: it's north of
    Falador, down the ladder in a house on the ice mountain.) Boot can be found by going southwest. He will tell you where the finest gold is
    found. Bring a pickaxe, good armor, a good weapon, and probably some food (you will need to defeat two level 122 Hellhounds).</div>
<br>
<img src="img/questimages/famcrest7.jpg" height="220" width="220"><img src="img/questimages/famcrest9.jpg" height="200" width="200"><br>
<br>
<br>
<div data-progress> 4. The finest gold is found in a dungeon east of Ardougne. To make this easy, go to East Ardougne and head southeast.
    You will find a ladder surrounded by archways. Go down the ladder. First you will meet some hobgoblins (level 48.). You can't access the
    finest gold directly; you'll need to pull several levers to activate the door. Go to where the door of the Hellhound is. Do the following
    steps to unlock the door where the gold is:
</div>
    Hint: If you don't know what a lever's status is (up or down) you can right click on it and click inspect. (Also, you may need to pull the
    levers in the opposite order from what the guide says.)<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:left;">
    <div data-progress>I) Go to the North wall and pull that lever up</div>
    <div data-progress>II) Back to the South room and pull that lever down</div>
    <div data-progress>III) Back to the North wall and pull the lever down</div>
    <div data-progress>IV) Go inside the North room and pull that lever up</div>
    <div data-progress>V) Go outside of the room and pull the lever on the North wall up</div>
    <div data-progress>VI) Go back to the South room and pull that lever down</div>
    <div data-progress>VII) Open the cage and mine 2 "perfect" ores. (Note: you may or may not have to kill them. Often times
        there is already someone killing them for range practice.)</div>
</div>
<br>
<img src="img/questimages/famcrest10.jpg" height="220" width="220"><br>
<br>
<div data-progress>5. Use these gold nuggets on a furnace, and now you will have two gold bars. Get your two rubies,
    a ring mould, a necklace mould, and your two gold bars made from the finest gold. Use a bar on the furnace to make a
    ruby ring and a ruby necklace.</div>
<br>
<div data-progress>6. Return to Al Kharid with your ruby ring and ruby necklace made from the finest gold and give them
    to the Nobleman. He will give you his piece and tell you about his younger brother.</div>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Third Son:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>1. For this part you will need a cure poison potion (it's a good idea to bring two, one for the son and one for you),
    probably some good armor, a good weapon, all of the runes needed to cast all four blast spells, and either a level 59 magic, or a Wizard's
    Mind Bomb (can be bought in Falador Bar for 2 coins). By the way, a Wizard's Mind Bomb temporarily increases your Magic level by three,
    so you can do this part if you have a level 56 magic or higher.</div>
<br>
<div data-progress>2. Once you have all of those items go to the Jolly Boar Inn. This is located northeast of Varrock. Check the world map
    if you can't find it (it's the large bar). Go inside and go to the southern end. On the <span data-floors="US">2nd floor</span> you will
    find, in a room, a wizard.</div>
<br>
<img src="img/questimages/famcrest11.jpg" height="220" width="220"><img src="img/questimages/famcrest12.jpg" height="220" width="220"><br>
<br>
<div data-progress>3. He is the third son. Talk to him—he has been poisoned. Give him your cure poison potion and he will be cured. He will tell you all
    about the poison spiders, and about Chronozon (121) having his piece of the crest. He will tell you that in order to kill Chronozon you will need
    to cast all of the blast spells on him.</div><br>
<br>
<img src="img/questimages/edgedung.png" height="443" width="265"><br>
<br>
<div data-progress>4. Now get all of the items mentioned in step 1 and go to Edgeville. Enter the dungeon, and deep inside you'll find a gate that
    can only be accessed on members' servers. (Examine the gates and eventually you will find one that says, "You can pass through this on members servers.")
    This gate is protected by a couple of aggressive skeletons. The members only area is known as the 'Wilderness Dungeon'.</div><br>
<br>
<div data-progress>5. Go through the gate and you will first meet some thugs (level 10). Head west and get past the Chaos Druids (level 13). Go
    north and get past the skeletons (level 45) by heading west into the narrow hallway.</div><br>
<br>
<div data-progress>6. You will need to get past Black Demons (level 172) and Poison Spiders (level 64). Once you feel ready, go west, then south.</div><br>
<br>
<div data-progress>7. Now you should be in a room with the Earth Obelisk and Chronozon (level 139). If he hasn't attacked you yet, initiate
    the fight. While you are killing him, you must successfully cast all of the Blast spells, just once. If you don't, he will regenerate.
    You can use prayers. Once you have killed him pick up the crest piece and get out! (Suggested method: Hide behind the pillar at the back
    of the cage, eliminate any Poison Spiders that attack you, cure your poison, and begin casting the Blast spells on Chronozon. He will not
    attack you from this position.)</div><br>
<br>

<h3>Finishing Up:</h3>
<div data-progress>Finishing the Quest: Now that you have all three pieces, put them together and go back and talk to Dimintheis.
    He will be grateful and will reward you. You can have them enhanced—see below. Remember, you can only choose one enhancement,
    so choose wisely.</div><br>
<br>
Enhancing the Gauntlets: Go to any son and talk to him. He will enhance the gauntlets for you if you want.<br>
