Items/Skills Needed To Start: 6 steel bars or 12 nails, three planks, 2000 gp (or an extra 10k for those that can't telegrab), an unfired bowl, a lobster pot, some silk, a wizard mind bomb, and items you think you need to kill Elvarg (the green dragon).<br>
<br>

<b>Starting Location: Champion's Guild</b><br>
<br>

Reward: 2 Quest Points, Strength XP (20k), Defence XP (20k), Completing the quest allows you to buy rune plate (84,500gp) AND Green Dragon Leather Body (10,400) from Oziach.<br>
<br>

1. Talk to the champion guild's master. Ask him about Rune Plate Mail and he'll tell you about Oziach. His house is near Edgeville.<br>
<br>

2. Talk to Oziach. Ask him about Rune Plate, where the Dragonfire Shield is, and the map pieces. He should have given you a key to Melzar's Maze.<br>
<br>

3. Go to the Oracle, located above the Dwarven Mines, with your silk, mindbomb, bowl, and lobster pot. She'll tell you about a door in the mines. Go down there. The door is near the east part of the mine. When inside (your silk, mindbomb, bowl, and lobster pot should disappear) check the chest. You'll get a map piece<br>
<br>

4. Grab some food if you think you need it. Go to Melzar's Maze (it's south of the crafting guild). Use your maze key on the door. Kill some giant rats until you get a red key. Use it on the NorthWest door. Go up the ladder.<br>
<br>

5. Kill ghosts until you get an orange key. Use it on the door SECOND FROM THE NORTH. A lot of people mess up here.<br>
<br>

6. Kill skeletons until you get a yellow key. Use it on the southwest door (the MOST southwest door, that is). Go down the ladders until you get to some zombies<br>
<br>

7. Kill zombies until you get a blue key. Use it on the northwest door. Kill Melzar the Mad until you get a key. (magenta colour). Go through the door.<br>
<br>

8. Kill the Lesser Demon and he'll drop the final key, which is green (thank you graystar!). Use it on the door. Check the chest and get the second map piece.<br>
<br>

9. Drop by a bank and take out either A) A bow and arrows B) Some runes to mage Wormbrain to death or C) 10k. If you brought the 10k, you don't need runes for telegrab. If you plan to kill Wormbrain, you need to telegrab the map piece.<br>
<br>

10A. Magers/Archers need to just attack Wormbrain in the Port Sarim jail. When he's dead, use telekentic grab on the map piece he drops. Use the map pieces on each other to form the map.<br>
<br>

10B. Pures/People unable to telegrab need to talk to wormbrain. Ask him about the map piece. He'll eventually tell you he'll sell it to you for 10k. Talk to him again and pay him. He should give you the map piece. Use the map pieces on each other to form the map.<br>
<br>

11. Go to Lumbridge and talk to the Duke in Lumbridge Castle. Ask him about a shield to protect you from a dragon. He'll give you the Dragonfire Shield. It's advised that you drop this one, get another one, and pick up the first one you dropped in case you die.<br>
<br>

12. Pick up your 2000 coins, a hammer, three planks, 12 nails, and your map from a bank. Head back to Port Sarim. Go to the dock east (?) of the food store. Talk to the captain. Keep talking until you can offer to buy the ship. He'll tell you the price. Buy it. Now, go on board and go down a deck. Use a plank on the hole near you. Keep using planks until the hole is filled. Talk to your swabbie to go off the ship.<br>
<br>

13. Now, go to Draynor. Talk to Ned and he'll offer to take you to Crandor. You give him your map and he tells you to meet you at the ship. This is the big fight you've been waiting for. Pick up potions, food, armor and weapons (magic, bow/crossbow) AND YOUR DRAGONFIRE SHIELD.<br>
<br>

14. Go to your ship (The Lady Lumbridge). Go down a deck and talk to Ned. Off to Crandor!<br>
<br>

15. When you get to Crandor, your ship'll be banged up. Walk off the ship and go up the hill. Follow the path until you reach some King Scorpions. Evade them and walk north until you get to another up point. Go up past here, and dodge the Lesser Demon. Go down the cave opening.<br>
<br>

16. Dodge the skeletons down here and walk past the stronger skeletons farther. Go through the door. CAUTION I'd take your potions RIGHT NOW if you have any. If you forgot to bring your Dragonfire Shield, I'd suggest you go get it before even attempting to kill Elvarg.<br>
<br>

17. This is it. Attack Elvarg (level 86). She hits quite hard for a level 86. When I fought her, she maxed out a 10. Eat when you need to, and make sure you don't die.<br>
<br>
18. When you beat her, you'll be transported outside. Don't freak out if a skeleton gets you, just walk towards the lessers (south, I believe) and go through the "secret" wall. The command should be "Open". Your character will "memorize" the location for farther use. Once you've done this you can either teleport to Lumbridge, or go sell some stuff at the general store for money to get off Karamja. *yay* You completed The Dragon Slayer! Go buy your rune plate, you champion you!<br>
