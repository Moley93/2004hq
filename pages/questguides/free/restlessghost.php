<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Father Aerick and he'll inform you of the situation. He wants you to visit Father Urhney, who is meditating in the swamps (how boring would that be?), and ask him how to get rid of the ghost.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go north around the castle, then west until you reach the edge of a fence. Head south of it and proceed east to the southeast corner of the swamp.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Talk to Urhney and he'll give you an Amulet of Ghostspeak, along with some info on what the ghost might want.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head back to the church graveyard and talk to the ghost. He'll be surprised that you can understand him. After getting over himself, he'll explain that a warlock stole his skull from his coffin and took it to an island — the Wizard's Tower Island.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Head over there and go into the basement. Look for a skull and take it. A skeleton will pop out — kill it, or just grab the skull and hightail it out of there.</div>
<br><br>
<div data-progress>Go back to the tomb and use the skull on the ghost's coffin. The ghost will vanish and whisper “thank you.” Of course, a minor thank you isn't going to cut it — so naturally, the ghost also gives you your reward. Quest complete.</div>
