<h3>Introduction</h3>
Random events are a feature Jagex have placed in Runescape to stop cheaters. They can occur at any time and any place - while you are doing anything! There are two types. Firstly, there are general events that can occur while you are doing anything - such as a genie appearing - and all you have to do is respond to them. Secondly, there are skill specific events which occur when you have been training that skill for a while. Again, all you have to do is respond to them.
<br><br>
Below, all the different random events are explained with details of when they appear, what they do and what you should do.

<h3>General Random Events</h3>
General Random events are not skill limited, they can happen anywhere and anytime and are there to make sure you are awake and at the keyboard.

If you ignore him and do not reply he will teleport you to a remote location<!-- [in 225] and note your inventory-->.</td></tr></table>
