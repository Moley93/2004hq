<b>2004HQ - Temple of Ikov</b><br>
<br>
Description: A mysterious stranger called Lucien asks you to go on a mission deep under the Temple of Ikov in central Kandarin. He wants you to retrieve an artifact known as the Staff of Armadyl. Towards the end of the quest you are presented with a choice on how to complete the quest.<br>
<br>
<b>Difficulty Level: <font color="Red">Hard</font></b><br>
<br>
Items/Skills Needed To Start: 42 thieving, 40 ranged, a Yew or Magic bow, a candle (can be bought in Catherby), a tinderbox, 20 limpwurt roots, a knife.<br>
<br>
Recommendations: Dragon leather ranger armor, prayer restore potions (if you have 37+ prayer and less than 50 ranged), Melee resistant armor (to withstand 15 minutes of attacks from level 61 ice spiders), a trustworthy friend to do the quest with.<br>
<br>
Starting Location: In the ‘Flying Horse’ bar west of the Ardougne River.<br>
<br>
Reward: 1 quest point, 10500 Ranged Exp., 8000 Fletching Exp., the ability to make steel darts, and admittance to the Temple of Ikov (by wearing the Pendant of Lucien).<br>
<br>
1. Talk to Lucien, he will be in the Flying Horse Bar, north west of the Paladin’s Tower, on the west side of the river. Lucien will tell you about how he needs the Staff of Armadyl. He gives you a pendant and asks you to get it for him.<br>
<br>
2. Put on the pendant and get ready to go to the dungeon. Get a candle from the Catherby Candle shop, and light it with a tinderbox. The things you should bring on this (1st) trip:<br>
<br>
- The Pendant of Lucien (never take this off)<br>
- Your lit candle<br>
- A knife<br>
(note: if you have a trustworthy friend doing the quest with you, bring the stuff for the 2nd trip as well, and have them hold onto it briefly while doing this part. This will save you the time of banking)<br>
<br>
3. Wearing the pendant, go into the Temple of Ikov (located directly southeast of the Ranging Guild).<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov1.gif" height="200" width="375"><br>
<br>
Go down the ladder and head west through the temple and then down the stairs. Go to the back of this room and cut though the spider web and pick up the Boots of Lightness*. Put them on, drop your knife and return up the stairs.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov2.gif" height="200" width="300"><br>
<br>
4. Go north into the room with the skeletons in it, and head to the west side of this room (you will see a broken bridge). Before going over the bridge, MAKE SURE YOUR WEIGHT IS BELOW ZERO!!! If it’s above zero you will fall in the lava, causing you 20 HP of damage. Once across the bridge, go into the room and grab the lever piece on the ground. Leave the temple and go back to the bank.<br>
<br>
(note: if you are above 0 KG weight, and you do fall into the lava, you can still grab the lever piece because you will land on the opposite side of the lava bank. Climb up the ladder and you will be in hemenster. You will have to walk back to the temple again if this happens)<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov3.gif" height="200" width="375"><br>
<br>
5. The things you should bring on this (2nd) trip:<br>
<br>
- The Pendant of Lucien (never take this off)<br>
- Your melee resistant armor<br>
- Lots of food<br>
- The lever piece<br>
(weapon is optional, only if you feel like killing the ice spiders. I just ignored them for this part and took the damage. If you are high combat level, then bring the items needed for the 3rd trip as well. You will need to withstand attacks from level 61 ice spiders for about 15 minutes of running around in the cavern. I was level 74 with full rune armor and I ate 8 bass during this part)<br>
<br>
In the first area of the temple when you first climb down the ladder, there is a lever bracket on the wall. Use your lever piece on this, then pull the lever. That will unlock the south gate.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov4.gif" height="200" width="300"><br>
<br>
6. Follow the path until you reach some chests, check every chest, eventually one will have some ice arrows in them. Keep checking the different chests until you have around 50. Remember the arrows are always in random chests, check every one of them, even the chest you just found the arrows in. The chests are in narrow offshoots of the main cavern. It is a long walk to get to the chests from the gate, so don't feel like you are lost. And don't expect the chests to be sitting out in the open, look on the minimap for the narrow offshoots from the main cavern.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov5.gif" height="200" width="375"><br>
<br>
7. Leave the snowy area and go back to the bank. The things you should bring on this (3rd) trip:<br>
<br>
- The Pendant of Lucien (never take this off)<br>
- Magic resistant armor<br>
- The yew or magic bow<br>
- Lots of food<br>
- Prayer Restore Potions (if you can use Protect from Magic, if you have 50 or higher ranged, then full prayer will be sufficient to kill him and you will not need to recharge until you are finished)<br>
<br>
For your armor, I would suggest Dragon Hide, because it gives 30+ magic defense, while rune armor gives around -10. Also, dragon hide armor gives you a ranged attack bonus which is very helpful in killing the Fire Warrior. If you have rune armor, it is better to fight him naked. Rune armor gives you a ranged attack penalty and a mage defense penalty. This guy mages you, he will not attack any other way, and you cannot hide behind a rock while you fight him. Equip everything, go down the ladder, north through the skeleton room, then straight north to a lever with a trap door. DO NOT IMMEDIATELY PULL THE LEVER! Search for traps on the lever and disarm it, then you may pull the lever. If you pull the lever without disarming the traps, then the trap door will open and you will fall on spikes taking up to 20 hp in damage. Then take the west branch until you get to a door. Open the door and go across the room to the next door. Try to open that door and Lesarkus the Fire Warrior will appear and say you may not pass. Then he will start maging you. You may range him with the ice arrows only. (I suggest your bow on Rapid setting, accurate if you have below 50 ranged). If you have magic block put this on so he can’t hurt you, and drink your prayer potions whenever your prayer is low. Once you kill him go back to the bank.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you do not kill him fast enough, he will stop the battle and tell you to come back when you have a better weapon. You can try again by simply trying to open the door again. Perhaps train your ranged skill some more or purchase a ranging pot. If you know a high level herbalist they will probably trade one for Dwarf Weed. This happened to my friend, and for her 2nd attempt, she merely un-equipped her rune armor and then killed him pretty easily.<br>
<br>

<br>
8. The things you should bring on this (4th) trip:<br>
<br>
- The Pendant of Lucien (never take this off)<br>
- Melee resistant armor<br>
- Weapon<br>
- Some food<br>
- 20 limpwurt roots<br>
Go down the ladder, and back to where you killed Lesarkus the Fire Warrior. Go through the door he wouldn’t let you through (you do not have to kill him again). You will see a witch named Winelda, talk to her she will offer to teleport you across the lava for your limpwurt roots.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov7.gif" height="200" width="350"><br>
<br>
Agree. Once over the lava, follow this path all the way to the end, past the room and the ladder, and you will see a shiny key on the ground.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov8.gif" height="200" width="350"><br>
<br>
Pick it up, and return to the room with the guardians in it. The Staff is in the northwest corner, but first, you have to make a decision.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov9.gif" height="200" width="300"><br>
<br>
Side with the Guardians<br>
<br>
Take off your pendant of Lucien. Talk to one of the Guardians of Armadyl. You will tell them that you are working for a man named Lucien. They will be quite disappointed to hear that. They will give you a pendant and tell you to kill him.<br>
You will find yourself in a room just north of McGrubbor’s Wood. Use your shiny key on the door and you should go through. Go to Varrock, and exit via the northeast exit, follow the wall surrounding the castle, west then south, and you will see a house with Lucien in it.<br>
<br>
<img src="img\questimages\ikov10.gif" height="200" width="350"><br>
<br>
Wearing your pendant attack him (he’s only level 14). You will be rewarded once you kill him.<br>
Side with Lucien<br>
There is a small room that contains the staff inside of the big room, when you try to take the staff, any of the guardians in the small room will attack you (level 36-40) pick it up once everyone in the small room is dead. Leave the big room and go up the ladder near you.<br>

Talk to him and give him the staff, you will be rewarded.<br>
<br>
*The Boots of Lightness actually have -4 weight, so they are good for running because you gain energy much faster. It isn’t a bad idea to grab a few of these on your 1st trip back to the bank<br>
